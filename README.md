<p>This is a website I designed and developed for my friend, Malik, so that he would be better able to showcase his window tinting business to customers and to ultimately help him secure more customers.</p>
<h4>Sections</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Hero: attracts viewers and show statistics regarding the product as well as its results</li>
  <li>Benefits: informs potential customers on the benefits of window tinting</li>
  <li>Packages: showcases the different packages offered to better fit specific customer needs</li>
  <li>Portfolio: display previous works for easy access to encourage customers via social proof(currently no pictures because this business actually transitioned into a car washing business before starting)</li>

  <li>Footer: collection of quick links and miscellaneous information</li>
</ol>
